This research was conducted with girls from both host (Lebanese) and refugee (including Syrian and Palestinian) communities. Lebanon has shown hospitality in accepting large refugee populations, however, there has been significant strain on the infrastructure and resources available to support these already vulnerable groups and inter-communal tensions can arise when different populations live together in over-crowded areas. This report focuses on adolescent refugee girls living in Beirut. It seeks to amplify their voices and perceptions of their lives and communities, and presents their views on how the humanitarian sector might respond to the challenges they face. We believe adolescent girlsâ€™ specific needs must be addressed to reduce the impact of disaster and help them reach their potential. This report, the first to do so, focuses on the lives and experiences of the adolescent Rohingya girls living in refugee camps in Bangladesh since fleeing conflict in Myanmar. Women in Lebanese refugee camps are raising awareness about the effects of violence and are helping survivors of abuse get support following training from Plan International and the International Medical Corps.
