This report captures promising gender transformative work taking place in politically and culturally conservative contexts, including programmes led by grassroots organisations. The findings are meant to be used:  12 million girls marry before the age of 18 each year – almost one every 2 seconds. We strive to enable girls to avoid early and forced marriage, stay in school and benefit from a quality education. Campaigners and stakeholders are celebrating news that instances of child marriage are decreasing globally. But our 18+ programme provides recommendations for making global efforts to end the practice more effective. Child, early and forced marriage has significant negative impacts on the futures of children, particularly girls. This harmful practice can expose girls to violence, unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion, denying them their basic rights to childhood, with damaging impact on their education, health and economic prospects.
