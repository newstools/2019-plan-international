Our policy aims to ensure that: We are deeply committed to realising children’s rights to protection and freedom from abuse and exploitation. This also means holding ourselves to account in ensuring that no child is harmed or placed at risk of harm as a result of their association with us. Every child has the right to feel safe, both at home and at school. Plan International is committed to protecting children from violence and working with the communities, schools and governments who can protect them from harm. Under our 5-year Global Strategy, we will strive for a just world that advances children's rights and equality for girls – working with vulnerable children and especially girls so that they can learn, lead, decide and thrive.
