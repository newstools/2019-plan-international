Plan International understands the urgency of taking climate action. This paper sets out the organisation's policy position on climate change, identifies areas where Plan International can add value and provides position statements on key issues. It is evidence-based and draws on Plan International’s own experience of working on climate change programmes and influencing. 
 
The paper provides an introduction to what climate change is and how it affects our work. It connects children’s rights and specifically girls’ rights to national level climate policies and their implications. It gives an in-depth exploration of 3 areas that are often excluded from global and national climate strategies and where Plan International can provide added value: One of the most devastating consequences of climate change will be a reversal of progress on girls’ rights and gender equality. These stories show how the inequalities experienced by marginalised girls and young women are amplified by the impacts of climate change. Children are the least responsible for creating global climate change but will bear the brunt of its effects. Plan International is supporting children to get their voices heard in the fight against the climate crisis and the need for resilience.
