Scandinavia has one of the largest gender gaps in technology in the world. The perpetual lack of young women entering the sector here has resulted in significant skills shortages, stagnant growth and inequality of opportunity. Technology companies are losing out from this dearth of female talent. But there is much they can do to help reverse this trend. Plan International, with support from Telenor, commissioned this report to identify existing evidence as to ‘what works’ to support girls and women into tech in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Initiatives to address the gender digital divide in these 3 countries are on the rise, yet rigorous evaluation of these programmes is lacking. This research breaks new ground; as well as mapping existing evidence and identifying evidence gaps, it presents new insights gained from speaking to experts and young women engaging in technology in Scandinavia. It concludes with recommendations for how tech companies can contribute to a more equal digital world. Technology and the internet can be a great enabler for girls but a lack of opportunities, skills and a fear of discrimination prevent many from using and creating digital tools and online content. Our new report gives recommendations on opening up digital career paths to girls and young women. It's vital girls participate in and contribute to our shared digital future if we are to achieve gender equality. On International Girls in ICT Day, Plan International's Nora Lindstrom discusses why and how the internet needs to change if we are to achieve gender equality.
