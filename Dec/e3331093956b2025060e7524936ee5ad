This report looks at the rates and experiences of reporting street harassment to authorities across five major cities (Lima, Madrid, Kampala, Delhi and Sydney.) Why is reporting to authorities often viewed as useless or even harmful, when in fact reporting is an important avenue for ending street harassment? In this new analysis of the original Free to Be data, girls and young women share their stories and reflect on their experiences. Our work in this space aims to shine a light on the issue so as to improve responses, increase reporting rates and ultimately end sexist behaviours and sexual harassment in public spaces to create safer cities for all. Sophie Sandberg, founder of Catcalls of NYC on how to deal with street harassment. Catcalling is not a compliment. It’s not harmless - it’s harassment. Here are some of the creative ways girls across the globe are finding to tackle street harassment. Gender-based violence (gbv) stops girls from reaching their potential. We're working to transform attitudes towards girls and women that perpetuate violence against them.
