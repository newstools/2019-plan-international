This report aims to document the findings of a comprehensive review of the historical and institutional partnership between Plan International (hereinafter referred to as Plan) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It captures the process and approaches that Plan has taken in engaging ADB; the key milestones, successes and lessons from such engagement; and the role that the partnership played in supporting wider youth engagement in ADB. Several tools have also been included in the report in order to guide the readers when engaging Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in similar partnerships. The partnership between Plan International and the Asian Development Bank will focus on the investment of young people as drivers of economic and social development, and as contributors to poverty reduction.
