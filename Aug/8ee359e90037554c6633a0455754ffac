The purpose of this report is to help inform more effective, contextualized interventions to address CEFM and teen pregnancy. The report documents case studies of programme innovations and successes carried out as part of Plan International’s 18+ Ending Child Marriage in Eastern and Southern Africa Programme (18+ RESA). This report also includes the stories of young people, told in their own words and images, who have confronted CEFM and teen pregnancy and risen above their challenges to become advocates for change in their communities. This report captures promising gender transformative work on child, early and forced marriages taking place in politically and culturally conservative contexts, including programmes led by grassroots organisations. 12 million girls marry before the age of 18 each year – almost one every 2 seconds. We strive to enable girls to avoid early and forced marriage, stay in school and benefit from a quality education. The global campaign demanding power, freedom and representation for girls and young women.
