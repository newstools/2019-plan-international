Child sponsorship has been a foundation of Plan Internationalâ€™s work since our beginnings. We currently engage with 1.4 million sponsored children in 481 countries through sponsorship activities, communications and programmes. Back in 2006 we began to record the annual surveys that are conducted with all sponsored children. Since then, we have generated a unique and vast dataset from more than 12 million surveys conducted among 2.7 million sponsored children.  Michael, 27, from Kwale Country, Kenya, is a former sponsored child with Plan International. Now, at the age of 27, he is working alongside Plan International to improve the lives of children in his country. Meet Luceli, 22, a former sponsored child from El Salvador who now runs her own bakery. She started her business after attending a cookery training course run through Plan International's youth entrepreneur project. Over 290 million children under 5 do not have a birth certificate. Using innovative approaches, we're working to achieve universal birth registration.
