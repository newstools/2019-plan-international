At Plan International, child-friendly feedback mechanisms are key to our accountability towards children, young people and their communities. These mechanisms provide them with critical information and opportunities to provide feedback on our humanitarian programming. Feedback mechanisms also play a critical role in safeguarding and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse. Our child-friendly feedback mechanisms are adapted to suit children of all ages, genders and those with disabilities. Children’s safety is also paramount during these processes and we promote their leadership in designing and implementing feedback mechanisms. The guide and 20 accompanying tools support practitioners to design, implement and monitor feedback mechanisms. The training manual includes session plans, handouts and exercises for face to face training sessions. Education is a fundamental right, yet in times of conflict and disaster it is often significantly disrupted, denying millions of girls and boys the opportunity to have a quality, safe education. Emergencies can have devastating effects on children’s lives, putting them at increased risk of abuse and neglect with adolescent girls among the most vulnerable. The Adolescent Girls in Crisis research is drawn directly from the voices and experiences of girls in three of the world’s most troubled and volatile locations: South Sudan, the Lake Chad Basin and the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.
